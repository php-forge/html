 * The `<li>` HTML element is used to represent an item in a list.
 * It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list `<ol>`, an unordered list `<ul>`, or a menu `<menu>`.
 * In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are
 * usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.
