# HTML

The **HTML** repository is a powerful tool for generating `HTML` code using `PHP`.

It provides a wide range of functionalities, including:

## Basic HTML Tags

The repository can generate basic `HTML` tags, allowing you to create `HTML` elements programmatically using `PHP`.

The following tags are currently supported:

## Input Tags

In addition to basic `HTML` tags, the repository also supports the generation of input tags.

This is particularly useful for creating forms and other interactive elements on a webpage.

## Traits

One of the standout features of the `HTML` repository is its use of `PHP` traits. Traits are a mechanism for code reuse
in single inheritance languages like `PHP`. They allow you to group specific functionalities together in a coherent way.
The `HTML` repository provides traits that you can use to assemble your own widgets. This gives you the flexibility to
create custom `HTML` elements that are tailored to your specific needs.

To use the repository, you would typically import the necessary classes and traits into your `PHP` script, and then call
the appropriate methods to generate the `HTML` code. The generated code can then be outputted to the browser or used in
other parts of your application.

Please note that the exact usage may vary depending on the specific classes and traits you are using. Be sure to check
the tests and traits in the repository for more detailed examples and usage instructions.

## Abstract Classes

The repository also provides a number of abstract classes that you can use to create your own custom widgets. These
classes provide a basic implementation of the `HTML` interface, and can be extended to create more complex widgets.

## Interfaces

The repository provides a number of interfaces that you can use to create your own custom widgets. These interfaces
provide a basic implementation of the `HTML` interface, and can be extended to create more complex widgets.
