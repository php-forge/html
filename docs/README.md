# HTML

The **HTML** repository is a powerful tool for generating `HTML` code using `PHP`.

It provides a wide range of functionalities, including:

## Basic HTML Tags

The repository can generate basic `HTML` tags, allowing you to create `HTML` elements programmatically using `PHP`.

The following tags are currently supported:

- [a](/docs/tag/A.md)
- [body](/docs/tag/Body.md)
- [button](/docs/tag/Button.md)
- [button toggle](/docs/tag/ButtonToggle.md)
- [div](/docs/tag/Div.md)

## Input Tags

In addition to basic `HTML` tags, the repository also supports the generation of input tags.

This is particularly useful for creating forms and other interactive elements on a webpage.

## Creating Custom Widgets

One of the standout features of the `HTML` repository is its utilization of `PHP` traits.

Traits serve as a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages like `PHP`, enabling the grouping of specific
functionalities in a coherent manner.

The `HTML` repository provides traits that can be employed to assemble custom widgets, offering the flexibility to
create `HTML` elements tailored to specific needs.

To use the repository, you would typically import the necessary classes and traits into your `PHP` script.

Subsequently, you would invoke the appropriate methods to generate `HTML` code. The generated code can then be sent to
the browser or used in other parts of your application.

It's important to note that the exact usage may vary depending on the specific classes and traits you are utilizing.

Be sure to review the tests and traits in the repository for more detailed examples and usage instructions.

Furthermore, the repository supplies various abstract classes that can be utilized to craft custom widgets.

These classes provide a fundamental implementation of the `HTML` interface and can be extended to develop more
intricate widgets.

Additionally, the repository furnishes several interfaces that can be used to create personalized widgets.

These interfaces offer a basic implementation of the `HTML` interface and can be extended to construct more complex
widgets.

This enhances the extensibility of the repository, empowering you to design personalized `HTML` elements efficiently.
